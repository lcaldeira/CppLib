Test labels:
    * get a [x] means 'succeed in the test'
    * get a [=] means 'almost complete success'
    * get a [-] means 'almost complete failure'
    * get a [ ] means 'had a total failure'
    * get a [o] means 'feature or test not present'
    * get a [?] means 'inconclusive result'
    * get a [v] means 'check valgrind output'
